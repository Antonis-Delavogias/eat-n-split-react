# [friend-balance-tracker]

**Project Goals:**

* Build a simple application to track balances and debts between friends.

* Employ React components for a modular, reusable structure.

* Utilize JavaScript state management to update the UI dynamically.

* Implement forms with validation for adding friends and splitting bills.

What I Learned:

* React Components: Structuring the app into reusable components like Friend, FormAddFriend, and FormSplitBill.

* State Management: Using React's useState hook to maintain the list of friends, the selected friend, and form data.

* DOM Manipulation within Components: Updating the UI (friend list, balance indicators, forms) based on changes in state.

* Conditional Rendering: Showing and hiding forms, and displaying messages about balances based on state values.

* Form Handling: Capturing user input, performing basic validation, and updating the application state accordingly.

Feel free to:

* Use the code as a foundation for your Friend Balance Tracker implementation.

* Discuss design decisions and potential enhancements to the application.
